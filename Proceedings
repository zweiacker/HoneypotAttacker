1. In etherscan search for Honeypot contract and check out the code.

2. Open a new file in remix (browser/AttackExer.sol) and copy the contract's code from etherscan to it.

3. Write the AttackPot contract doing the exploit.

4. hard-coded the Pot's address into the AttackPot contract, so it would send tx to that specific contract only.

5. Activate Metamask locally in the browser.

6. In Remix, switch Environment to "Injected Web3" which will display the Metamask-controlled Robsten account(s). Must at least hold 0.5 ether.

7. Deploy the AttackPot contract, giving a value at start of 0.5 ether.

8. CallPut with 500000000000000000 (0.5 ether), so Honeypot assigns that value to the balances mapping for the Attacker contract.

9. CallGet - will exploit by re-entering 10 times (making count rise to 11 in the end).
